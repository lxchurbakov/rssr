# RSSR

RSS posts search and index engine.

## How it works

The crawler simply goes and fetches all the posts from a list of curated feeds. Upon fetching, posts are stored in the database and available for search. While viewing, users update the views count on posts as well as tags, that later can be reused to improve search results.
